# Hi, I'm Arjun Vikram

## I am a :biking_man: Freshman at [:evergreen_tree: Stanford University](https://cs.stanford.edu/) in :round_pushpin:Palo Alto, CA! 

I'm interested in:

- :brain: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- :gear: DevOps and MLOps
- :dna: Bioinformatics
- :robot: Robotics
- :desktop_computer: Systems Programming
- :abacus: Mathematics

I graduated as :2nd_place_medal: Salutatorian from the :mortar_board: [School of Science and Engineering (SEM)](https://www.semagnet.org/) in :cowboy_hat_face: Dallas, TX!

### I'm currently working with [@DagsHub :dog:](https://github.com/dagshub) ([dagshub.com :paw_prints:](https://dagshub.com/)) as an :man_technologist: Open Source ML Engineer, developing OSS data science projects that showcase MLOps tools and best practices.

In the past, I've

- Researched applying :eye: Computer Vision techniques to Cancer Histopathology with the [:test_tube: Rajaram Lab at UT Southwestern](https://www.rajaramlab.org/).
- Volunteered with the [:basketball: Mark Cuban AI Foundation](https://markcubancompanies.com/projects/ai-bootcamps/) to :man_teacher: teach the basics of Artificial Intelligence to :woman_student: high school students from underserved communities with :negative_squared_cross_mark: no technical background.
